# allegro5_demo_1
Playing around with 3D demo scene old Amiga demo scene. I dislike licences as I feel they contradict themselves or apply too much written to simply use the code. I borrowed source off Allegro docs and modified them, so Allegro terms hold, and if not  be my guest to learn, copy and share.
